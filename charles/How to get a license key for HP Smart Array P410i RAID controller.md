# How to get a license key for HP Smart Array P410i RAID controller
 
If you have a HP ProLiant server with a Smart Array P410i RAID controller, you may want to use some advanced features such as RAID 6 or online capacity expansion. However, these features require a license key that is not included with the controller. How can you get a license key for your P410i?

There are a few options to obtain a license key for your P410i:
 
- Buy a license key from HP or an authorized reseller. This is the official and recommended way to get a license key for your P410i. However, this option may be expensive or unavailable depending on your location and the availability of the product.
- Use an evaluation license key from HP. HP provides a 60-day trial license key for the Smart Array Advanced Pack (SAAP) that enables all the advanced features of the P410i. You can download the SAAP from [here](https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/swd/public/detail?swItemId=MTX_7f6c0b0a9a8c4e9f9f3b0c2b7d) and use the following license key: 34T62-N84MB-7DQGY-G7XGT-YTQ63. Note that this license key will expire after 60 days and you will need to buy a permanent license key or revert to the basic features of the P410i.
- Use an unofficial license key from online sources. Some users have reported finding license keys for the P410i on GitHub, Reddit, or other websites. These license keys may or may not work for your P410i and may have unknown risks or consequences. Use them at your own discretion and responsibility.

In conclusion, if you want to use the advanced features of the P410i, you will need a license key that can be obtained from different sources. The best option is to buy a license key from HP or an authorized reseller, but you can also try an evaluation license key from HP or an unofficial license key from online sources.

Once you have a license key for your P410i, you will need to install it using the Array Configuration Utility (ACU). The ACU is a web-based tool that allows you to configure and manage your RAID controller and arrays. You can access the ACU from the SmartStart CD, the HP System Tools CD, or the online ROM-Based Setup Utility (RBSU).
 
To install a license key in ACU, follow these steps:

1. Open ACU and click the Configuration tab.
2. Select a controller from the Controller/Device menu.
3. In the Available Tasks panel, click Manage License Keys.
4. Click Add License Key.
5. Enter License Key number.
6. Click Save.

When activated with a registered license key, SAAP provides the following features for your P410i:

- RAID 6 (ADG): This is a fault-tolerant RAID level that can withstand two simultaneous drive failures without data loss. It uses an advanced distributed parity algorithm that distributes parity information across all drives in the array.
- RAID 60: This is a nested RAID level that combines RAID 6 and RAID 0. It provides high performance and high fault tolerance by striping data across multiple RAID 6 sub-arrays.
- Advanced Capacity Expansion: This feature allows you to add new drives or replace existing drives with larger ones without taking the array offline. You can also migrate from one RAID level to another while the array is online.
- Mirror splitting and recombining in offline mode: This feature allows you to split a mirrored array into two independent arrays or recombine two independent arrays into a mirrored array in offline mode. This can be useful for backup or disaster recovery purposes.
- Drive Erase: This feature allows you to securely erase all data on a physical drive before disposing or reusing it. It overwrites the data with random patterns multiple times to prevent data recovery.
- Performance optimization for video on demand: This feature optimizes the performance of the array for streaming video applications by adjusting the read-ahead cache and stripe size parameters.

For more information on how to configure these features, please refer to the Controller and/or Array Configuration Utility user guide.
